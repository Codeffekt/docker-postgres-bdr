# Docker image for postgres 9.4 with BDR support

Based on Debian Jessie. Includes a patched postgres with support for [BDR](http://bdr-project.org/)

Image heavily borrowed from the [official image](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres) for postgres.
Look there for further usage instructions.
